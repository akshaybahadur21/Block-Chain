A module to understand the working of blockchains for humans.


## Code Requirements 🦄
The example code is in Python ([version 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/) or higher will work). 
1) import hashlib
2) import datetime

### Description ⛓️

A blockchain is a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography. Each block typically contains a hash pointer as a link to a previous block, a timestamp and transaction data. By design, blockchains are inherently resistant to modification of the data. A blockchain can serve as "an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way."

The first distributed blockchain was conceptualised by an anonymous person or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto, in 2008 and implemented the following year as a core component of the digital currency – bitcoin – where it serves as the public ledger for all transactions.
